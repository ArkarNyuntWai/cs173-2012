** Some notes
* I created these notes by typing on Emacs as I watched the video.
* There are weird markups that I made up, feel free to clean it up. 
* Please feel free to fix any grammar errors or factual errors and send me a pull request.
* Use it together with video and slides.

** TODO (hint! hint!)
* use Racket scribble and produce some nice set of notes at the end of the course.
